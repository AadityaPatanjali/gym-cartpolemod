This repository contains a PIP package which is a modified version of the 
CartPole-v0 OpenAI environment which includes cart and pole friction and also
adds a new 'do nothing' action.


## Installation

Install the [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/).

Then install this package via

```
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```
import gym
import gym_cartpolemod

env = gym.make('CartPoleMod-v0')
```
## The Environment

Some parameters for the cart-pole system:
- mass of the cart = 1.0
- mass of the pole = 0.1
- length of the pole = 0.5 
- magnitude of the force = 10.0
- friction at the cart = 5e-4
- friction at the pole = 2e-6
