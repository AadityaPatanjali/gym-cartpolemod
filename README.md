This repository contains a PIP package which is a modified version of the 
CartPole-v0 OpenAI environment which includes cart & pole friction and random sensor & actuator noise.


## Installation

Install [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/).

Then install this package via

```
git clone http://github.com/AadityaPatanjali/gym-cartpolemod.git
cd gym-cartpolemod
sudo pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Python usage:
```
import gym
import gym_cartpolemod

env = gym.make('CartPoleMod-v0')
```
Examples:
Versions go from v0 through v6 for different noise scenarios
```
cd example_files
python deepQNetwork.py v1
```

## The Environment

Some parameters for the cart-pole system:
- mass of the cart = 1.0
- mass of the pole = 0.1
- length of the pole = 0.5 
- magnitude of the force = 10.0
- friction at the cart = 5e-4
- friction at the pole = 2e-6

Noise cases(v0 to v6):
- v0: Noise free
- v1: 5%  Uniform Actuator noise
- v2: 10% Uniform Actuator noise
- v3: 5%  Uniform Sensor noise
- v4: 10% Uniform Sensor noise
- v5: 0.1 var Gaussian Sensor noise
- v6: 0.2 var Gaussian Sensor noise

Note: The sensor noise is added to the angle, theta alone, and the actuator noise is added to the force.

Some Neural network parameters:
- Discount rate     : gamma = 0.95
- Exploration rate  : epsilon = 1.0
- Exploration decay : 90%
- Learning rate 	: 0.01
- NN Input layer	: 24 neurons, tanh activation function
- NN Hidden layer	: 48 neurons, tanh activation function
- NN Output layer	: 2 neurons, linear activation function
- MSE loss function with Adam Optimizer
- Seed			: None (Both in deepQNetwork and cartpolemod_env)

Note: To give a seed, uncomment line# 17 in deepQNetwork and change line# 76 in cartpole_mod to the desired seed value. 

Notations:
- 1 run	      	  : 1000 trials
- 1 trials    	  : 60,000 time-steps
- 1 time step 	  : 0.02s
- Success rate	  : successful runs for 100 runs
- Successful trial: System lasts 60k time steps without failing
- Successful run  : Atleast one successful trial in 1000 trials
- Average trials  : Mean trials to successful trial over 100 runs
- Execution time  : Approximate average time of execution for 100 runs

## Results
|CartpoleMod Version|Noise type|Success rate|Average trials|Execution time|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|v0|Noise free|100%|119.68|~ 4.5 hours|
|v1|5% Uniform Actuator Noise|100%|118.88|~ 4.5 hours|
|v2|10% Uniform Actuator Noise|100%|130.47|~ 4.5 hours|
|v3|5% Uniform Sensor Noise|100%|123.93|~ 5.5 hours|
|v4|10% Uniform Sensor Noise|100%|133.67|~ 5.5 hours|
|v5|σ^2 = 0.1 Gaussian Sensor Noise|100%|179.36|~ 6.5 hours|
|v6|σ^2 = 0.2 Gaussian Sensor Noise|98%|209.59|~ 8 hours|
